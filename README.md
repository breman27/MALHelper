# MALHelper

I just made this to make it easier on myself to use the myanimelist API in java. Anyone is welcome to contribute.

In order to use this helper yourself, download the code and change the USER and PASS constants in src/search/MALSearch.java

Currently only supporting searches, will add more functionality over time.
